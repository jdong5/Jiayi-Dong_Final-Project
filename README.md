Final Project Process Documentary

### How did I get started?
For my thesis project, I’ve always been committed to sustainable fashion field. By collaborating with behno, a fashion company, I was planning to make a supply chain map for all parts of one product using the source they provided. However, as a business, behno had a hard time to offer me the sourcing information more than a country’s name, which I also understood. Thus, in order to make a meaningful map, I decided to change my direction. Along with the progress of my thesis focus, I moved my attention to artisan’s social need. I was very interested in showing how do people think of artisans and the reason behind it.

### Purpose of my project:
By interviewing residences living in Suzhou city on their thoughts of Su Embroidery artists, I want to collect valuable and condensed data that allows me consolidate and reflect my learning in Data visualization, and also help me take steps forward on my thesis project of this specific problem: Su Embroidery artists are disconnected from society and undervalued by the public

## The process of my project
### Data collecting:
I created an online questionnaire through www.wenjuan.com, which is a popular tool for social research among Chinese. I posted the questionnaire only with a geographical filter: Suzhou city. I received 230 answers within 3 days. Among all of the Q&As, One sentence answer to a question interests me that contains a lot of diversity and commonality, “What do you think of Su Embroidery Artists?” I decided to dig into these answers/data sets.

### Conception:
I first read through all the answers and I noticed that a lot of keywords were highly repeated, while some just appeared once. After putting down all the keyword mentioned by the interviewees on a paper, I tried to integrate, distinguish, organize and classify them into different categories on describing the Su Embroidery artists. Then, I found that the category that represents the community’s emotions towards the artisans has the least amount of keywords, 7, comparing to 143 keywords on how the local community feel about their expertise, 107 keywords on what they feel about the artisans’ nature, 23 keyword on their unfamiliarity of the artisan group, 20 keywords on how the artisan group look like for them, 15 keywords on how do the artisan make them feel. This discovery strongly backs me up on my thesis procedure: co-creating an uplifting space for Su Embroidery Artists to develop emotional connections with the local community to have their value acknowledged and having their status restored.

### Visualization:
I made a draft that containing a summary amount of keywords for each category, together with the amount for each keyword using circles and lines to create the sets and relationships within each other. During my individual talk with Joey, I learned that it’s confusing and nonsense to show a summary of the keywords, and it's more powerful and clear to focus on exhibit each keyword and what they are. After several prototypes, I made a Data Visualization map with a radial looking that contains all the valid data I collected.

### Reflections and Challenge
During the process, I’ve learned how to balance data and visual in one environment. I’m aware that the data set is the foundation of every next step I followed with. Meanwhile, I’m also aware that clear and informative visual can help data be much easier to understand, visible, and accessible.

One challenge I faced is to define valid data. In some situations, I went back to the interviewees and ask them to clarify; In some other situations, I used my knowledge of Chinese vocabulary, and Chinese dictionary to distinguish similarity, differences and make decisions. 
Another challenge is the translation. English and Chinese are two totally different language system, and one keyword sometimes cannot be translated to another language in perfect vibes. For this challenge, I have thought of just using the Chinese language for this project, but I gave up this idea. My audience is not only residences in Suzhou, but I want to prepare the topic to everyone in this world, and English is the most popular language. In addition, I want to overcome this challenge to see language is not a barrier if only we want to communicate.

### Next Steps
My next steps are: process the answers I got from the artisans by asking, “What do you think the local community thinks of you?”. Similarly, to compare the data from the artisans’ side and from the local community side. (From my current research, the artisans are lack of and need emotional support from the local community to continue their work.)
By combining two sets of data, and put them into one map that could exhibit the emotional gap between the two groups, which reflects the need of my thesis intervention.

Here is the final !!!
